  "description": "In the basic contract, the auctioneer would claim the tokens from the final bid of the contract via logging into the contract accounts wallet using a key. It is a security issue for there to exist a key for a smart contract since the key holder can take the funds from the contract at any point, maliciously change the contract or just delete the contract as a whole. To stop exploitation we will lock the contract by removing all access keys and implementing a new method to claim the tokens.",
