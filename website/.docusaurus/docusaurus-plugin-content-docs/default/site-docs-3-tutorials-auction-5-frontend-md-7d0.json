  "description": "Now that we have successfully created a contract, it's time to build a frontend to provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with it. Up until now, we have been using the CLI to send transactions and view the contract's state. However, frontends offer a more intuitive way for end users to interact with the contract. They can display all the relevant information in one place, allow users to make calls with a simple button click, and only require a wallet as a prerequisite.",
