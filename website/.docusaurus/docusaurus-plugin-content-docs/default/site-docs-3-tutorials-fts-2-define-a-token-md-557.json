  "description": "This is the first of many tutorials in a series where you'll be creating a complete FT smart contract from scratch that conforms with all the NEAR FT standards. Today you'll learn what a Fungible Token is and how you can define one on the NEAR blockchain. You will be modifying a bare-bones skeleton smart contract by filling in the necessary code snippets needed to add this functionality.",
