## The cNEAR library

I want to share a library I have been working, to interact with the NEAR blockchain using the C language. This lib allows many kind of devices (like a wifi router or a gaming console) to use the Near chain.
The only requirement (beyond a compiler) is the libcurl library, that leverages the networking communication with the RPC servers.

Right now, this library will let you interact with smart contracts deployed on the Near blockchain (either testnet or mainnet), and call/view methods.
When calling methods that change the contract state, remember that you'll need to initialize the library with a signer account (private/public key) so the library can sign the TX and execute the contract method.

It's still an early development so more features can be added; if you find bugs or want to request additional features, feel free to ping or open an issue on the GitHub repo.

## How to use it

Using the cNEAR library, I made a sample PlayStation 3 app that connects to a smart contract running on the NEAR testnet network, and gets/sets the current message on the contract state.

Probably the first time a gaming console is using NEAR ðŸ˜„ Anyways, I just wanted to test the library is truly portable and can be used almost anywhere:
- the PS3 arch is completely different (Big Endian vs little-endian, etc)
- compiled using an old GCC v7 cross-compiler toolchain
- built using an open-source homebrew SDK (psl1ght sdk)
- the sample app can be tested on a PS3 emulator too
