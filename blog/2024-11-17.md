## The cNEAR library

Recently I have been working in a client library to interact with the NEAR blockchain using the C language. Since this library is written in C, and there are C compilers for many processor architectures, it allows different devices beyond the usual web-browser on PC (like a WiFi router or a gaming console) to interact with the Near blockchain.
The only requirement (beyond a C compiler) is the [libcurl library](https://curl.se/libcurl/), that leverages the networking communication with the RPC servers.

At the current development stage, the [cNEAR library](https://github.com/bucanero/cnear-poc) lets you interact with smart contracts deployed on the Near blockchain (either `testnet` or `mainnet`), and `call` or `view` contract methods.
When calling methods that change the contract state, remember that you need to initialize the library with a blockchain account (using a private/public key pair) so the library can sign the transaction, pay the gas fees, and execute the contract method.

As mentioned, this C library is still an early development proof of concept, so more features could be added in the future to support other blockchain actions such as token transfers or batch transactions.

### How to use it

Now let's review the basic usage, with some code examples:

- Initialize the library and set the RPC server:
```c
// init the library
if (!near_rpc_init("https://rpc.testnet.near.org", true))
{
    printf("Error initializing RPC");
}
```

- Set the Near account used to sign transactions:
```c
#define TEST_PUBKEY     "ed25519:FY835wAj7g8fRMncf4tqkyT3YdoW71t1ERnt3L78R28i"
#define TEST_PRVKEY     "ed25519:36gU64pAbTLH6uuxUeGvwF8n3fUfnDRSC87Z7Q5Ez2WdhcCy2KB6KtGX1WDcym6VezUhojWN4waBiwFAvxtXXNJN"

// set the account keys
if (!near_account_init("my-account.testnet", TEST_PRVKEY, TEST_PUBKEY))
{
    printf("Error initializing account");
}
```

- Call a smart contract on the NEAR blockchain and get the current state:
```c
cnearResponse result;
// Call a contract function 'get_greeting' on contract 'demo-devhub-vid102.testnet'
// with empty JSON arguments
// Note: this is a view function (read-only), so it doesn't require gas
result = near_rpc_call_function("demo-devhub-vid102.testnet", "get_greeting", "{}");

if(result.rpc_code == 200)
{
    size_t len;
    char* contract_msg = (char*) near_decode_result(&result, &len);

    if (contract_msg)
    {
        printf("---\n%s\n---\n", contract_msg);
        free(res);
    }
}
free(result.json);
```

- Call a smart contract on the NEAR blockchain and set a new state:
```c
cnearResponse result;
// Call a contract function 'set_greeting' on contract 'demo-devhub-vid102.testnet'
// with JSON arguments '{"greeting":"Hello cNEAR!"}'
// Note: this is a change method that modifies the contract's state,
// so it's a signed transaction (require gas, and a signer account)
result = near_contract_call("demo-devhub-vid102.testnet",
            "set_greeting",
            "{\"greeting\":\"Hello cNEAR!\"}",
            NEAR_DEFAULT_100_TGAS, 0, NEAR_TX_STATUS_EXEC_OPTIMISTIC);
```

The library provides other methods too, that you can [check here](https://github.com/bucanero/cnear-poc#library-functions).

## Example PS3 App

To showcase how to use the cNEAR library, and to prove that it can be used to build applications in different platforms, I created a sample [PlayStation 3 app](https://github.com/bucanero/cnear-poc/tree/main/sample-ps3) that uses the library, connects to a [simple smart contract](https://docs.near.org/build/smart-contracts/quickstart#the-contract) running on the NEAR `testnet` network, and gets or sets the current greeting message on the contract's state.

Some notes about the portability that the C library enables in this example app:
- the PS3 architecture is a [custom PowerPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(processor)) (64-bit, Big-Endian)
- the app was compiled using a GCC v7.2.0 [cross-compiler toolchain](https://github.com/ps3dev/ps3toolchain)
- built using an open-source PS3 SDK ([PSL1GHT SDK](https://github.com/ps3dev/PSL1GHT/))
- the compiled [sample app](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iR_aaH7BPIGA9_HHKJI1S6nVyR-vNhcM/view?usp=sharing) can be tested on a PS3 emulator too


## Building your own library

For those developers that don't use C, but perhaps would like to use a different programming language (like Java, C#, Go) and integrate the NEAR blockchain in their projects, I'll present a short road map on how to build your own client library from scratch.

### Basics

On a high-level, a client library needs to communicate with a NEAR node using the [JSON-RPC API](https://docs.near.org/api/rpc/introduction), by encoding requests and decoding responses in the expected JSON format for each method. In the same way, tools like [`near-cli`](https://docs.near.org/tools/near-cli) and [`near-api-js`](https://docs.near.org/tools/near-api-js/quick-reference) are just abstractions making RPC calls.

So, if you want to build your own client library, you'll need to:
- handle HTTP connections to the RPC server.
  * For the cNEAR library, I used [libcurl](https://curl.se/libcurl/) to handle the HTTP network communications. Your language might provide specific libraries for HTTP requests.
- handle JSON messages and responses to communicate with the RPC server.
  * For the cNEAR library, I used [cJSON](https://github.com/DaveGamble/cJSON), but your language might have support for JSON serialization through native libraries or packages.
- handle Base64 and Base58 encodings, as some NEAR fields use these encodings.
  * For the cNEAR library, I included some open-source [reference implementations](https://github.com/bucanero/cnear-poc/blob/main/src/base64.c).
- handle [Borsh serialization](https://borsh.io/), as NEAR transactions are binary encoded in this specific serialization standard.
  * For the cNEAR library, I did my own [Borsh encoding routines](https://github.com/bucanero/cnear-poc/blob/22321808f5502bbcc945d1a737bf4cd18404ff0b/src/cnear.c#L138). Borsh deserialization isn't needed if you're just building a client.
- handle ed25519 signatures, so your client can sign transactions using a NEAR account's private key.
  * For the cNEAR library I used an open-source [ed25519 implementation](https://github.com/floodyberry/ed25519-donna).

### Implementation

Now, let's see how things can be implemented so the client code can achieve a successful interaction with the NEAR network.

For this example, we aim to call a smart contract method `set_greeting`, set a new greeting value `"hello world"`, and sign the transaction with a `testnet` account. If we dig into the NEAR protocol documentation, we'll find that to call a contract that changes the blockchain state, we need to create a [Signed Transaction](https://nomicon.io/RuntimeSpec/Transactions#signed-transaction) with a [FunctionCall Action](https://nomicon.io/RuntimeSpec/Actions#functioncallaction) that specifies the contract's method and arguments.

Let's use the [near-cli](https://github.com/near/near-cli-rs) with the awesome `--teach-me` parameter, so the CLI will show us the whole process between the CLI and the RPC server.

```sh
near --teach-me contract call-function as-transaction demo-devhub-vid102.testnet set_greeting json-args ' {"greeting" : "hello world" }' prepaid-gas '100.0 Tgas' attached-deposit '0 NEAR' sign-as solops2.testnet network-config testnet sign-with-legacy-keychain display
```

Once you execute the `near` command, you'll get a low-level detail of the whole process to generate a base64-encoded signed transaction:

```
Unsigned transaction:

signer_id:    solops2.testnet
receiver_id:  demo-devhub-vid102.testnet
actions:
   -- function call:
                   method name:  set_greeting
                   args:         {
                                   "greeting": "hello world"
                                 }
                   gas:          100.0 Tgas
                   deposit:      0 NEAR

 |      }
 |    }

 |      "nonce": 66097883000050,
 |      "permission": "FullAccess"
 |    }

```

You can see that the CLI calls the RPC server, and using the public key from the `testnet` account, it requests the RPC [`view_access_key` method](https://docs.near.org/api/rpc/access-keys#view-access-key). The response provides two values that are required to build the transaction:
 - `block_hash` = `DTAXqtkUdpUp1oaPThYVMLYu1QnT2KzQFhisuQ3iCsSp `
 - `nonce` = `66097883000050`

Using those values, the CLI generates a [transaction](https://nomicon.io/RuntimeSpec/Transactions#signed-transaction) with a FunctionCall action that calls `set_greeting`, serializes it using Borsh, and then signs it with the private key of the `testnet` account.

```
Your transaction was signed successfully.

```

You can use the CLI to print the details of this base64-encoded signed transaction:

```sh
near transaction print-transaction signed 'DwAAAHNvbG9wczIudGVzdG5ldABWZI8xXoQFnilyGUEmEPxsqxg1hcdnIY2lLY+snNEf6vMs1pwdPAAAGgAAAGRlbW8tZGV2aHViLXZpZDEwMi50ZXN0bmV0uQAfK/w+8BKQJhwJzbP0lq4q217VghNNcGLtlzKkZykBAAAAAgwAAABzZXRfZ3JlZXRpbmcaAAAAeyJncmVldGluZyI6ImhlbGxvIHdvcmxkIn0AQHoQ81oAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAkUn66wC30xf2CFUjFE8oOlArYiinVPBHau+zTbP8iFWq/xJ9QM9TWpTG9VmWi31H+hQwCEE0lQlDxPNx5gdbDQ=='
```

You can see that the signed transaction has all the details about the smart contract, the method, arguments, the public key, block hash, and the incremented nonce (`nonce++`):

                   method name:  set_greeting
                   args:         {
                                   "greeting": "hello world"
                                 }
                   gas:          100.0 Tgas
                   deposit:      0 NEAR
```

Now that you have the Base64 signed transaction, you're ready to send the transaction to the RPC server, so the transaction gets executed and changes are committed to the blockchain. Let's use the `near-cli` again, to see how it works:

```sh
near --teach-me transaction send-signed-transaction 'DwAAAHNvbG9wczIudGVzdG5ldABWZI8xXoQFnilyGUEmEPxsqxg1hcdnIY2lLY+snNEf6vMs1pwdPAAAGgAAAGRlbW8tZGV2aHViLXZpZDEwMi50ZXN0bmV0uQAfK/w+8BKQJhwJzbP0lq4q217VghNNcGLtlzKkZykBAAAAAgwAAABzZXRfZ3JlZXRpbmcaAAAAeyJncmVldGluZyI6ImhlbGxvIHdvcmxkIn0AQHoQ81oAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAkUn66wC30xf2CFUjFE8oOlArYiinVPBHau+zTbP8iFWq/xJ9QM9TWpTG9VmWi31H+hQwCEE0lQlDxPNx5gdbDQ==' network-config testnet send
```

Once you execute the `near` command, you'll get a low-level detail of the whole communication process to submit the signed transaction:

As shown in the log, the CLI sends a JSON message to the RPC server calling the [`broadcast_tx_commit` method](https://docs.near.org/api/rpc/transactions#send-transaction-await), setting the Base64 signed transaction as `params`.
If the transaction was crafted correctly, and the signature is valid, the RPC server will reply with the transaction outcome, logs, and receipts.
